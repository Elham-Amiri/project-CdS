(CdS)33 Quantum dots Studied by density functional theory: Electronic and Optical Properties and Accounting for many body effects

Below you can find the details about how we use these inputs and files to study electronic and optical properties of `Cd33S33 Quantum structure` by density functional theory. also Accounting for many body effects done.
In this research, after downloading the (CdS)33 quantum dot structure, optimization steps were performed for it.
the details of which are given in part `geometry optimization`.
